# Reporting a Bug

Thank you for your interest in helping improve ClanGen! We're sorry to hear you've encountered issues, and we hope we
can help resolve them!

### Bugs as a result of save editing

A quick aside before we begin: ClanGen does not support editing your own saves manually. Although we host resources that
help you do so, these are player-maintained and not affiliated with ClanGen in any way. Bugs as a result of save-editing
will NOT be investigated or fixed, and any issues that arise as a result of editing saves are the player's sole
responsibility.

!!! warning "Reporting bugs with edited saves"
Do not submit bug reports for bugs encountered on an edited save. If you encounter a bug whilst playing on an edited
save, only report it if you can replicate it in an unedited save.

   !!! tip
   If you don't see something that looks like this, ensure you selected std**OUT**, not std**ERR**.

#### Playing development

On development versions of ClanGen, the commit number is in the bottom-right of every screen.

#### Can't open the game?

If the game immediately crashes, you can get to the default log location manually.

=== "Stable (executable)"
| Operating System | Default Location |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `C:\Users\[current user]\AppData\Local\ClanGen\ClanGen\logs` |
| Mac | |
| Linux | |
!!! todo
...what are the default locations for other OSes?

=== "Stable (from source)"
Wherever the active source files are stored, inside a folder called `logs`.

=== "Development (executable)"
| Operating System | Default Location |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `C:\Users\[current user]\AppData\Local\ClanGen\ClanGenBeta\logs` |
| Mac | |
| Linux | |
!!! todo
...what are the default locations for other OSes?

=== "Development (from source)"
Wherever the running source files are stored, inside a folder called `logs`.

### What's a patrol ID? Do I need it?

The patrol ID is a string that the game and developers use to refer to the sequence of events in a patrol. It might look
like this: `gen_hunt_rabbit`.

If you encountered your issue on the Patrol screen at some point after selecting cats, we'll want the patrol ID to
investigate what happened.

### How do I find the patrol ID?

See the section on [finding your game version](#how-do-i-find-my-game-version) to find the stdout file. Scroll right to
the bottom of that file and find the affected patrol (it can be identified by which cats were on it if it's not the last
one).

### How do I find the error log?

See the section on [finding your game version](#how-do-i-find-my-game-version) to find the logs directory. Instead of
selecting `stdout`, find and upload the most recent `stderr`. You can either upload the file or copy its contents, but
the entire file's contents are required.
