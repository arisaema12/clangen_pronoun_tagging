# Basic
This will cover the basic information for code.

## General tips
### Ways to find things in the codebase if you don’t know where they are
* ctrl + shift + F (search all files in project for keywords)
* ctrl + click (follow function calls and class initializations to their definitions)
* if you’re trying to find code for what happens on a screen in response to clicking something, check the screen’s handle_event() function for what code runs when that button is pressed
* keep playing around with fixing bugs or adding new features. Eventually you’ll develop an intuition for where things will probably be in the codebase

## Game Config
The [game config](https://github.com/ClanGenOfficial/clangen/blob/development/resources/game_config.json), found in 
resources/game_config.json, holds several developmental settings that are used within ClanGen. These settings are 
used to control chances of certain events happening, relationship values, patrol generation, and more.

**The first set of settings control relationship values.**

`"in_decrease_value":{
"low": 8,
"medium": 12,
"high": 16
}`

This sets the exact relationship value changes after interactions. Interactions, found in the relationships tab, can have a high, medium, or low effect on cats. These effects can be positive or negative.

`"max_interaction": 5`

This sets the max amount of interactions a cat can have each moon.

`"max_interaction_special": 8`

This sets the max amount of interactions a cat with a special role (leader, deputy, medicine cat, or mediator) can have each moon.

`"compatibility_effect": 5`

This sets the positive or negative effect that interactions will have on other cats based on their personalities. Some personalities are compatible with each other, some are neutral, some are not compatible. 

`"passive_influence_div": 1.5`

This setting helps set a buff for interactions that increases other values other than the main value. For example, if a cat has a positive romantic interaction with another cat, their platonic like and comfort levels will also increase, and their dislike will decrease. Increasing this setting's value will decrease the buff.

`"chance_for_neutral": 10`

This setting sets how high the chance is to make the interaction neutral instead of negative or positive. 1/chance
			
`"chance_of_special_group": 8`

Often when a group event is happening, only a special group is used, which is defined in group_types.json. 1/chance

`"chance_romantic_not_mate": 15`

This is the base chance of an romantic interaction with another cat, when a cat has a mate. 1/chance
